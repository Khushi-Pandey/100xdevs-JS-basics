# Expression-
- A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.
- Every value written literally is an expression. 
  for ex: 77; or 'Khushi'

# Operators in javascript:

++a will print a+1
-> first increments then prints

a++ will print a
-> first prints then increments

== equal to
=== equal value & type

# Destructuring assignment:

used to unpack values from an array (or properties from objects), into distinct variables

//in Array-
say we have 
let arr = [3, 5, 8, 9, 4, 7];
/* a = arr[0];
   b = arr[1];
instead of this */
[a, b, c, ...rest] = arr;  // rest-> left elements will be as an array if we print this    console.log(a, b, c, rest);
let's we want a to be 3 and want rest to start from 9
so we can do [a, , b, ...rest] = arr;  now if we print arr it will give 3 8 [9,4,7]
// in Object-
const obj = {a:1, b:2}
const {a, b} = obj
this will help in concise code and easy access as now a,b are both properties & variables and . syntax don't have to be used to access the properties
